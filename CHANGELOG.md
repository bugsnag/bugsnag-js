# Changelog

<!-- {entry_placeholder} -->

## 4.6.3 (2018-05-10)

### Fixed
- Use the correct network breadcrumb type (`network` -> `request`). Fixes network breadcrumbs not displaying in the dashboard. (#348)


## 4.6.2 (2018-05-08)

The previous version (v4.6.1) was removed from the npm registry and the CDN because of critical issue surrounding history state methods. This release resolves that issue. The release notes for v4.6.1 are included here too for completeness.

### Fixed
- Fix history API url parameter logic (#347)
- Only pass in `url` parameter to history methods when it is not `undefined`. Fixes a bug in IE11 where it converts `undefined` to a string, causing a redirect to `/undefined`. (#342)
- Prevent a crash in IE10 when accessing `history.state`. (#345)


## 4.6.1 (2018-05-03)

A couple of fixes for IE10/11 relating to quirks in their implementation of the history APIs.

### Fixed
- Only pass in `url` parameter to history methods when it is not `undefined`. Fixes a bug in IE11 where it converts `undefined` to a string, causing a redirect to `/undefined`. (#342)
- Prevent a crash in IE10 when accessing `history.state`. (#345)


## 4.6.0 (2018-04-20)

### Added
- It is now possible to customize the logger by setting the `logger` option of the configuration object. A custom logger must have the methods `debug`, `info`, `warn` and `error`. To completely disable logging, set `logger: null`. (#340)

### Fixed
- A custom version of [safe-json-stringify](https://github.com/bugsnag/safe-json-stringify) now fully protects against circular structures returned from toJSON() and arbitrarily wide/deep structures (#338)


## 4.5.0 (2018-04-06)

### Added
- New breadcrumbs! Breadcrumbs are now left when requests are made using XMLHttpRequest (ajax) or fetch(). This works with all request libraries out of the box: jQuery, axios, superagent etc. Metadata includes HTTP method, request url and the status code (if available). By default network breadcrumbs are collected all with other autoBreadcrumb types. If you don't want to collect network breadcrumbs, set `networkBreadcrumbsEnabled: false`. (#334)

### Changed
- As part of #334 [envify](https://github.com/hughsk/envify) was added to compile out plugin "destroy" logic that was only required for tests.


## 4.4.0 (2018-03-15)

### Changed
- Switch from a protocol-relative default for endpoint and sessionEndpoint to "https://". IE8/9 will attempt to send via http if the protocol of the current page is http. Otherwise all requests will now go via https unless configured otherwise (#333).

### Fixed
- Fix rollup bundling issue (switching to a forked version of cuid) (#331)


## 4.3.1 (2018-03-07)

### Changed
- Perf improvements for breadcrumbs, most notably console log methods with lots of data (#329)


## 4.3.0 (2018-02-23)

<!-- optional: if this is a significant release, describe it in a sentence or two -->

### Added
- Stub exported types to appease Angular's JIT compiler in dev mode (#323)
- Make hasStack(err) check more strict, making the unhandled rejection handler more robust and useful (#322)

### Changed
- Strip query strings and fragments from stackframe files (#328)
- Switch to upstream version of `fast-safe-stringify`


## 4.2.0 (2018-01-24)

This release fixes a few issues with the fetching of inline
script content, particularly after the location has changed
due to window.history methods.

Unhandled promise rejection should also contain more actionable
information (when the rejection reason is a DOMException, null,
or undefined). Support for Bluebird promises was also added.

### Added
- Support for unhandled bluebird promise rejections (#317)
- Option to prevent IP collection (#313)

### Changed
- Improved serialization of promise rejection reasons (#317)
- If a string was thrown and not caught, use it as the error message (#319)

### Fixed
- Collection of inline script content improved (#320, #318)


## 4.1.3 (2018-01-15)

- Fix call to non-existent `logger.log()` (credit @alexstrat #304)


## 4.1.2 (2018-01-09)

### Added
- Session sending now respects `notifyReleaseStages` option

### Changed
- Rename option `enableSessionTracking` -> `autoCaptureSessions` for consistency with other platforms

## 4.1.0 (2018-01-05)

### Added

In addition, sessions can be indicated manually using `bugsnagClient.startSession()` (#296)

- Bower and jspm support has been added as a result of #297 and some additional configuration

### Changed
- `dist` directory (built assets) are now stored in git (#297)


## 4.0.3 (2017-12-15)

- Add frameworks section to README.md
- Add READMEs to examples

### Changed
- Add more detail to JS example (credit @tremlab, #284)
- Ensure empty/useless stackframes are removed
- Removed arbitrary timeouts from tests to alleviate CI flakiness

### Fixed
- Expose `metaData` and `user` types on `Client` class (#287)
- Give navigation details the correct type (some were marked as "manual")

### Changed
- Improve type definition for notify() error argument (credit @rokerkony)
