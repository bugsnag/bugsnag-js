# Changelog

<!-- {entry_placeholder} -->

## 4.4.0 (2018-03-15)

<!-- optional: if this is a significant release, describe it in a sentence or two -->

### Added
- Stub exported types to appease Angular's JIT compiler in dev mode (#323)
- Make hasStack(err) check more strict, making the unhandled rejection handler more robust and useful (#322)

### Changed
- Strip query strings and fragments from stackframe files (#328)

## 4.2.0 (2018-01-24)

This release fixes a few issues with the fetching of inline
script content, particularly after the location has changed
due to window.history methods.

Unhandled promise rejection should also contain more actionable
information (when the rejection reason is a DOMException, null,
or undefined). Support for Bluebird promises was also added.
