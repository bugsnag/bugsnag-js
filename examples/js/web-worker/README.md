# Web-Worker

This is an example project showing how to use `@bugsnag/web-worker` with a web worker.

## Usage

Clone the repo and `cd` into the directory of this example:

```
git clone git@github.com:bugsnag/bugsnag-js.git --recursive
cd bugsnag-js/examples/js/web-worker
```

Take a look atâ€¦
- [`worker.js`](worker.js) to see how to start BugSnag to capture errors in the worker
- [`script.js`](script.js) to see how to prevent duplicate events being reported when also using BugSnag in the parent script that initializes the worker

Note that for this non-Node example, the `@bugsnag/js` notifier is included in the parent script through a `<script>` tag in [`index.html`](index.html) while `@bugsnag/web-worker` is included in [`worker.js`](worker.js) through an `import` statement. This is due to `@bugsnag/js` being a CommonJS module while `@bugsnag/web-worker` is an ES Module.

Firstly, replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in [`worker.js`](worker.js) with your own, then use the instructions below to run the application. Be aware that `Bugsnag.start` is commented out by default within [`script.js`](script.js) as it is not a requirement for using BugSnag within the worker. This is only necessary if you want to capture errors within the parent script as well.

### Running the Example

Ensure you have a version of Node.js >=14 on your machine.

```
npm install
npm start
```

Once started, it will serve a page at http://localhost:8067 with buttons that trigger handled and unhandled errors within the worker.
