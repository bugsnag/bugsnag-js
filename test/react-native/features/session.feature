Feature: Sessions

Scenario: Automatic session on app start
  When I run "SessionAutoEnabledScenario"
  Then I wait to receive a session
  And the session "bugsnag-api-key" header equals "12312312312312312312312312312312"

  And the session "Content-Type" header equals "application/json"
  And the session "Bugsnag-Sent-At" header is a timestamp

  When I run "SessionJsControlledManualJsScenario"
  Then I wait to receive 2 sessions
  And I wait to receive 4 errors
