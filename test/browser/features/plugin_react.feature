@plugin_react
Feature: React support

Scenario: basic error boundary usage
  When I navigate to the URL "/plugin_react/webpack4/index.html"
  And the test should run in this browser
  Then I wait to receive a request
  And the request is a valid browser payload for the error reporting API
  And the exception "errorClass" equals "Error"
  And the exception "message" equals "borked"
  And the event "metaData.react.componentStack" is not null
