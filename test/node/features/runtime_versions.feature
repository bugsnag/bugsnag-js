Feature: Reporting runtime versions

Background:
  Given I store the api key in the environment variable "BUGSNAG_API_KEY"
  And I store the endpoint in the environment variable "BUGSNAG_NOTIFY_ENDPOINT"
  And I store the endpoint in the environment variable "BUGSNAG_SESSIONS_ENDPOINT"

Scenario: report for unhandled event contains runtime version information
  And I run the service "unhandled" with the command "node scenarios/thrown-error-not-caught"
  And I wait to receive a request
  Then the request is valid for the error reporting API version "4" for the "Bugsnag Node" notifier
  And the event "unhandled" is true
  And the event "device.runtimeVersions.node" matches "(\d+\.){2}\d+"

Scenario: report for handled event contains runtime version information
  And I run the service "handled" with the command "node scenarios/notify"
  And I wait to receive a request
  Then the request is valid for the error reporting API version "4" for the "Bugsnag Node" notifier
  And the event "unhandled" is false
  And the event "device.runtimeVersions.node" matches "(\d+\.){2}\d+"

Scenario: session payload contains runtime version information
  And I run the service "sessions" with the command "node scenarios/start-session"
  And I wait to receive a request
  Then the request is valid for the session reporting API version "1" for the "Bugsnag Node" notifier
  And the payload has a valid sessions array
  And the payload field "device.runtimeVersions.node" matches the regex "(\d+\.){2}\d+"
