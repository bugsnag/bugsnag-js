# Testing the Bugsnag JS notifier

## Initial setup

Clone and navigate to this repo:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:bugsnag/bugsnag-js.git
cd bugsnag-js
```

Install top level dependencies:

```js
npm i
```

Bootstrap all of the individual packages:

```sh
npm run bootstrap
```

Build each of the standalone packages:

```sh
npm run build
```

## Unit tests

Runs the unit tests for each package.

```sh
npm run test:unit
```

## Type tests

This tests the validity of .d.ts files by attempting to compile a TypeScript program that uses Bugsnag.

```sh
npm run test:types
```

## Linting

Lints the entire repo with ESLint. On JavaScript files this uses the [standard](https://github.com/standard/eslint-config-standard) ruleset and on TypeScript files this uses the [@typescript/eslint](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/tree/master/packages/eslint-plugin) recommended set of rules.

```sh
npm run test:lint
```

## End to end

These tests are implemented with our notifier testing tool [Maze runner](https://github.com/bugsnag/maze-runner).

End to end tests are written in cucumber-style `.feature` files, and need Ruby-backed "steps" in order to know what to run. The tests are located in the top level [`test`](/test/) directory.

Maze runner's CLI and the test fixtures are containerised so you'll need Docker (and Docker Compose) to run them.

__Note: only Bugsnag employees can run the end-to-end tests.__ We have dedicated test infrastructure and private BrowserStack credentials which can't be shared outside of the organisation.

#### Authenticating with the private container registry

You'll need to set the credentials for the aws profile in order to access the private docker registry:

```
aws configure --profile=opensource
```

Subsequently you'll need to run the following commmand to authenticate with the registry:

```
npm run test:test-container-registry-login
```

__Your session will periodically expire__, so you'll need to run this command to re-authenticate when that happens.

### Browser

The browser tests drive real, remote browsers using BrowserStack. As a Bugsnag employee you can access the necessary 
credentials in our shared password manager.

#### Building the test fixtures

Use the `local-test-util` to build the test fixture, including the notifier from the current branch:

```shell script
./bin/local-test-util init
```

#### Running the end-to-end tests

The following environment variables need to be set:

- `MAZE_DEVICE_FARM_USERNAME`
- `MAZE_DEVICE_FARM_ACCESS_KEY`
- `HOST` - the test fixture host, typically `localhost`
- `API_HOST` - the MazeRunner mock server host, typically `localhost`

The browsers available to test on are the keys in [`browsers.yml`](https://github.com/bugsnag/maze-runner/blob/master/lib/maze/browsers.yml).

To run all the tests, run the following in `test/browser`:

```shell script
bundle exec maze-runner --farm=bs --browser=chrome_latest
```

Or to run a single feature file:

```shell script
bundle exec maze-runner --farm=bs --browser=chrome_latest features/device.feature
```

### Node

To run the Node test suite:

```sh
npm run test:node
```

You can use the `NODE_VERSION` env var to choose which version of Node to run the tests on. The default version is `10`.

To run a single feature file:

```sh
npm run test:node -- features/unhandled_errors.feature
```

### Expo

The Expo tests drive real, remote mobile devices using BrowserStack. As a Bugsnag employee you can access the necessary credentials in our shared password manager.

They also require access to the Expo ecosystem in order to publish, then build, the installable app packages. As above, these credentials can also be found in the shared password manager.

The following environment variables need to be set:

- `DEVICE_TYPE`: the mobile operating system you want to test on â€“ one of ANDROID_5_0, ANDROID_6_0, ANDROID_7_1, ANDROID_8_1, ANDROID_9_0, IOS_10, IOS_11, IOS_12
- `MAZE_DEVICE_FARM_USERNAME`
- `MAZE_DEVICE_FARM_ACCESS_KEY`
- `EXPO_USERNAME`
- `EXPO_PASSWORD`

To run against an android device:

```sh
DEVICE_TYPE=ANDROID_9_0 \
EXPO_USERNAME=xxx \
EXPO_PASSWORD=xxx \
  npm run test:expo:android
```

Running tests against an iOS device locally is not currently supported.

### React-native

The React-native tests drive real, remote mobile devices using BrowserStack. As a Bugsnag employee you can access the 
necessary credentials in our shared password manager.

The test fixture (a React Native app) that tests are run against needs to be built with a published version of 
@bugsnag/react-native.  By default, the build process will base this on the current branch/comment, 
e.g. `7.5.2-my-branch.e8cbdad2f4`, which needs to be published first if building locally.  For example, if using 
[Verdaccio](https://verdaccio.org/docs/en/docker.html):
```
node ./scripts/publish.js http://localhost:4873
```

This can also be overridden using the environment variable `NOTIFIER_VERSION`, which is useful during development when 
making test, but not notifier, changes.


If building against the current branch/commit, the packages must be published to a locally owned NPM repository 
(! Not the official NPMJS repository !). This can be locally or remotely hosted, but should be versioned appropriately.  

Three bits of information will need to be passed into the test run as environment variables in order to 
access this package:
- `REG_BASIC_CREDENTIAL`: the basic auth credentials of an account able to access the repository
- `REG_NPM_EMAIL`: the email of the user accessing the repository
- `REGISTRY_URL`: the remote address of the repository

The targeted release of `@bugsnag/react-native` must be tagged with the short hash of the current commit in order to be 
picked up by the gradle build process.

There are several react-native versions that can be targeted and the `REACT_NATIVE_VERSION` environment variable should 
be set accordingly:

| React native fixture | `REACT_NATIVE_VERSION` |
|----------------------|------------------------|
| 0.60                 | `rn0.60`               |
| 0.63                 | `rn0.63`               |

#### Building the test fixture

Remember to set the following variables:
- `REACT_NATIVE_VERSION`
- `REGISTRY_URL`
- `NOTIFIER_VERSION` (optionally)

For iOS:
```shell script
npm run test:build-react-native-ios
```

Fnd Android:
```shell script
npm run test:build-react-native-android
```
These will build a `.ipa` or `.apk` file respectively and copy into `./build`.

#### Running the end-to-end tests

Ensure that the following environment variables are set:
- `MAZE_DEVICE_FARM_USERNAME` - Your BrowserStack App Automate Username
- `MAZE_DEVICE_FARM_ACCESS_KEY` - Your BrowserStack App Automate Access Key
- `MAZE_BS_LOCAL` - Location of the BrowserStack local testing binary

See https://www.browserstack.com/local-testing/app-automate for details of the required local testing binary. In
particular, these commands need the `BrowserStackLocal` binary (available 
[here](https://www.browserstack.com/local-testing/releases) to reside in your home directory.  

1. Change into the `test/react-native` directory
1. Check the contents of `Gemfile` to select the version of `maze-runner` to use.
1. To run a single feature on an Android device (as an example):
    ```shell script
    bundle exec maze-runner --app=../../build/${REACT_NATIVE_VERSION}.apk \
                            --farm=bs \
                            --device=ANDROID_9_0 \
                            --a11y-locator \
                            features/app.feature
    ```
1. Or on iOS:
    ```shell script
    bundle exec maze-runner --app=../../build/${REACT_NATIVE_VERSION}.ipa \
                            --farm=bs \
                            --device=IOS_13 \
                            --appium-version=1.18.0 \
                            --a11y-locator \
                            features/app.feature
    ```
1. To run all features, omit the final argument.
1. Maze Runner also supports all options that Cucumber does.  Run `bundle exec maze-runner --help` for full details.

### React-native CLI

The react-native CLI come in three parts:

- CLI tests, that don't require any remote connections or special setup
- Testing an app build, which requires your local machine to be set up for building iOS and Android applications
- Testing the built app, which requires the built application from the previous test set to run

#### CLI tests

The CLI tests target the command line interface by providing a set of responses to expected queries, verifying that the CLI tool responds correctly and makes appropriate changes to the workspace.

##### Setting up

1. Run through the initial setup
1. Run `npm pack packages/react-native-cli/` to pack the react-native-cli package
1. Copy the resulting package, `bugsnag-react-native-cli-{VERSION}.tgz` into the target fixture, e.g.:
    ```shell script
    cp bugsnag-react-native-cli-*.tgz test/react-native-cli/features/fixtures/rn0_60/
    ```

##### Running

1. Change directory into `test/react-native-cli`
1. Check the contents of `Gemfile` to select the version of `maze-runner` to use
1. Install maze-runner with `bundle install`
1. Run the full set of cli tests targeting a specific react-native version (`rn0_61` for example):
  ```shell script
  REACT_NATIVE_VERSION=rn0_61 bundle exec maze-runner features/cli-tests
  ```

#### Build tests

The build tests come in two flavours, Android and iOS, and are required to run the subsequent tests using the resulting `.apk` and `.ipa` artefacts.  These tests ensure that the app can be built after Bugsnag is installed, and subsequent build messages are sent and contain the appropriate information.

##### Setup

1. Change directory into `test/react-native-cli`
1. Check the contents of `Gemfile` to select the version of `maze-runner` to use
1. Install maze-runner with `bundle install`

##### Running the Android variant

- Run maze-runner targeting the specific Android build feature for a specific react-native version (`rn0_61` for example):
  ```shell script
  REACT_NATIVE_VERSION=rn0_61 bundle exec maze-runner features/build-app-tests/build-android-app.feature
  ```

##### Running the iOS variant (MacOS only)

- Run the script to trigger the build for the specific react-native version (`rn0_62` for example):
  ```shell script
  ./scripts/init-and-build-test.sh rn0_62
  ```

#### App tests

These tests ensure that Bugsnag has successfully been installed by the CLI, and errors and sessions are correctly reported.

##### Setup

Before running these tests the previous tests, `Build Tests` must be run for the test fixtures to be present.

1. Change directory into `test/react-native-cli`
1. Check the contents of `Gemfile` to select the version of `maze-runner` to use
1. Install maze-runner with `bundle install`

##### Running

Ensure that the following environment variables are set:
- `MAZE_DEVICE_FARM_USERNAME` - Your BrowserStack App Automate Username
- `MAZE_DEVICE_FARM_ACCESS_KEY` - Your BrowserStack App Automate Access Key
- `MAZE_BS_LOCAL` - Location of the BrowserStack local testing binary

See https://www.browserstack.com/local-testing/app-automate for details of the required local testing binary. In
particular, these commands need the `BrowserStackLocal` binary (available 
[here](https://www.browserstack.com/local-testing/releases) to reside in your home directory.

1. To run on an Android device (`rn0_63` for example):
    ```shell script
    bundle exec maze-runner --app=./build/rn0_63.apk \
                            --farm=bs \
                            --device=ANDROID_9_0 \
                            --a11y-locator \
                            --bs-local=~/BrowserStackLocal \
                            features/run-app-tests
    ```
1. Or on iOS:
    ```shell script
    bundle exec maze-runner --app=../../build/rn0_63.ipa \
                            --farm=bs \
                            --device=IOS_13 \
                            --a11y-locator \
                            --bs-local=~/BrowserStackLocal \
                            features/run-app-tests
    ```
