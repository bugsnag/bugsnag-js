# Testing the Bugsnag JS notifier

## Initial setup

Clone and navigate to this repo:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:bugsnag/bugsnag-js.git --recursive
cd bugsnag-js
```

Install top level dependencies:

```js
npm i
```

Build each of the standalone packages:

```sh
npm run build
```

## Unit tests

Runs the unit tests for each package.

```sh
npm run test:unit
```

## Type tests

This tests the validity of .d.ts files by attempting to compile a TypeScript program that uses Bugsnag.

```sh
npm run test:types
```

## Linting

Lints the entire repo with ESLint.

```sh
npm run test:lint
```

## End to end

These tests are implemented with our notifier testing tool [Maze runner](https://github.com/bugsnag/maze-runner).

End to end tests are written in cucumber-style `.feature` files, and need Ruby-backed "steps" in order to know what to run. The tests are located in the top level [`test`](/test/) directory.

Maze runner's CLI and the test fixtures are containerised so you'll need Docker (and Docker Compose) to run them.

__Note: only Bugsnag employees can run the end-to-end tests.__ We have dedicated test infrastructure and private BrowserStack credentials which can't be shared outside of the organisation.

#### Authenticating with the private container registry

You'll need to set the credentials for the aws profile in order to access the private docker registry:

```
aws configure --profile=opensource
```

Subsequently you'll need to run the following command to authenticate with the registry:

```
npm run test:test-container-registry-login
```

__Your session will periodically expire__, so you'll need to run this command to re-authenticate when that happens.
