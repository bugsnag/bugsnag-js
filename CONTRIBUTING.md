## Reporting issues
Are you having trouble getting started? Please [contact us directly](mailto:support@bugsnag.com?subject=%5BGitHub%5D%20bugsnag-js%20-%20having%20trouble%20getting%20started%20with%20Bugsnag) for assistance with integrating Bugsnag into your application.
If you have spotted a problem with this module, feel free to open a [new issue](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-js/issues/new?template=Bug_report.md). Here are a few things to check before doing so:

* Are you using the latest version of Bugsnag? If not, does updating to the latest version fix your issue?
* Has somebody else [already reported](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-js/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen) your issue? Feel free to add additional context to or check-in on an existing issue that matches your own.
* Is your issue caused by this module? Only things related to `@bugsnag/js` (including `@bugsnag/plugin-*` plugins to support various frameworks) should be reported here. For anything else, please [contact us directly](mailto:support@bugsnag.com) and we'd be happy to help you out.

### Fixing issues

If you've identified a fix to a new or existing issue, we welcome contributions!
Here are some helpful suggestions on contributing that help us merge your PR quickly and smoothly:

* [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the
  [library on GitHub](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-js)
* Build and test your changes. We have automated tests for many scenarios but its also helpful to use `npm pack` to build the module locally and install it in a real app.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* [Make a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)
* Ensure the automated checks pass (and if it fails, please try to address the cause)

### Adding features

Unfortunately we’re unable to accept PRs that add features or refactor the library at this time.
However, we’re very eager and welcome to hearing feedback about the library so please contact us directly to discuss your idea, or open a
[feature request](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-js/issues/new?template=Feature_request.md) to help us improve the library.

Here’s a bit about our process designing and building the Bugsnag libraries:

* We have an internal roadmap to plan out the features we build, and sometimes we will already be planning your suggested feature!
* Our open source libraries span many languages and frameworks so we strive to ensure they are idiomatic on the given platform, but also consistent in terminology between platforms. That way the core concepts are familiar whether you adopt Bugsnag for one platform or many.
* Finally, one of our goals is to ensure our libraries work reliably, even in crashy, multi-threaded environments. Oftentimes, this requires an intensive engineering design and code review process that adheres to our style and linting guidelines.


## System requirements

In order to develop on the project you’ll need to be on Mac/Linux٭. You’ll need:
- [node](https://nodejs.org) `v8+` (which includes [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) 5+)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/)

If you want to run the end-to-end tests locally you'll need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (including Docker Compose), and the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/). Note that you'll also need some BrowserStack and AWS credentials which are only available to Bugsnag employees.

## Testing

A full guide to testing can be found in the [testing](./TESTING.md) document

## CI

CI runs on Buildkite. Tests are run automatically on any branch from within this repo. PRs from external repos do not run on the private test infrastructure. Once an external PR has been reviewed by a Bugsnag employee, a branch can be created within this repo in order to run on CI.

⚠️ __Caution__: exercise due-diligence before creating a branch based on an external contribution – for example, be sure not to merge a bitcoin miner disguised as a bug fix!

## Releases

To start a release:

- decide on a version number
- create a new release branch from `next` with the version number in the branch name
`git checkout -b release/vX.Y.Z`
- update the version number and date in the changelog
- make a PR from your release branch to `main` entitled `Release vX.Y.Z`
- get the release PR reviewed – all code changes should have been reviewed already, this should be a review of the integration of all changes to be shipped and the changelog
- consider shipping a [prerelease](#prereleases) to aid testing the release

Once the release PR has been approved:

- merge the PR into main

You are now ready to make the release. Releases are done using Docker and Docker compose. You do not need to have the release branch checked out on your local machine to make a release – the container pulls a fresh clone of the repo down from GitHub. Prerequisites:

- You will need to clone the repository and have Docker running on your local machine.
- Ensure you are logged in to npm and that you have access to publish packages in the `@bugsnag` namespace
- Ensure you have an AWS key pair with access to our S3 bucket and cloudfront distribution. Export these in your environment as `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (if you're going to publish to the CDN)
- Ensure your `.gitconfig` file in your home directory is configured to contain your name and email address
- Generate a [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) on GitHub and store it somewhere secure

Build the release container:

`docker-compose build release`

Then make the release:

```
GITHUB_USER=<your github username> \
GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=<generate a personal access token> \
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxx \
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxx \
RELEASE_BRANCH=main \
VERSION=patch \
DIST_TAG=latest \
  docker-compose run release
```

This process is interactive and will require you to confirm that you want to publish the changed packages. It will also prompt for 2FA.

Browser bundles are automatically uploaded to the CDN if they have changed.

<small>Note: if a prerelease was made, to graduate it into a normal release you will want to use `patch` as the version.</small>

Finally:

- create a release on GitHub https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-js/releases/new
- use the tag vX.Y.Z as the name of the release
- copy the release notes from `CHANGELOG.md`
- publish the release
- update and push `next`:
    ```
    git checkout next
    git merge main
    git push
    ```

### Prereleases

If you are starting a new prerelease, use one of the following values for the `VERSION` variable in the release command:

```
VERSION=[premajor | preminor | prepatch]
```

For subsequent iterations on that release, use:

```
VERSION=prerelease
```

For example:

```
GITHUB_USER=<your github username> \
GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=<generate a personal access token> \
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxx \
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxx \
RELEASE_BRANCH=main \
VERSION=preminor \
DIST_TAG=next \
  docker-compose run release
```

Prereleases will automatically be published to npm with the dist tag `next` and browser bundles are automatically uploaded to the CDN.

The dist tag ensures that prereleases are not installed by unsuspecting users who do not specify a version – npm automatically adds the `latest` tag to a published module unless one is specified.

### Release issues

#### Failed to publish all packages

Problem: `lerna publish` failed part-way through meaning not all packages were published.

To remedy this:
 - First work out whether a cdn upload is required as the check used in `release.sh` is no longer valid since the `lerna version` step took place.
 - Then re-run using the `RETRY_PUBLISH` and `FORCE_CDN_UPLOAD` flags as required:

```
GITHUB_USER=<your github username> \
GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=<generate a personal access token> \
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxx \
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxx \
RELEASE_BRANCH=main \
VERSION=patch \
DIST_TAG=latest \
RETRY_PUBLISH=1 \
FORCE_CDN_UPLOAD=1 \
  docker-compose run release
```
