# @bugsnag/expo

Error reporting for [Expo](https://expo.io/) apps.

This notifier is for Expo apps that only have JS – no native code. For [ejected](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v32.0.0/workflow/glossary-of-terms/#eject) Expo apps and non-Expo React Native apps, you'll need to use the [`bugsnag-react-native`](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-react-native) notifier.
