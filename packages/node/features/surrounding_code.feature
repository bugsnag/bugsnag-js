Feature: Loading surrounding code for stackframes

Background:
  Given I store the api key in the environment variable "BUGSNAG_API_KEY"
  And I store the endpoint in the environment variable "BUGSNAG_NOTIFY_ENDPOINT"
  And I store the endpoint in the environment variable "BUGSNAG_SESSIONS_ENDPOINT"

Scenario: loading surrounding code by default
  And I run the service "surrounding_code" with the command "node scenarios/send-code-default"
  And I wait to receive a request
  Then the request is valid for the error reporting API version "4" for the "Bugsnag Node" notifier
  And the payload field "events.0.exceptions.0.stacktrace.0.code" matches the JSON fixture in "features/fixtures/surrounding_code/scenarios/template.json"

Scenario: loading surrouding code when sendCode=true
  And I run the service "surrounding_code" with the command "node scenarios/send-code-on"
  And I wait to receive a request
  Then the request is valid for the error reporting API version "4" for the "Bugsnag Node" notifier
  And the payload field "events.0.exceptions.0.stacktrace.0.code" matches the JSON fixture in "features/fixtures/surrounding_code/scenarios/template.json"

Scenario: not loading surrouding code when sendCode=false
  And I run the service "surrounding_code" with the command "node scenarios/send-code-off"
  And I wait to receive a request
  Then the request is valid for the error reporting API version "4" for the "Bugsnag Node" notifier
  And the payload field "events.0.exceptions.0.stacktrace.0.code" is null
